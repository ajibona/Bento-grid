## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

These is the first projects i design with a full CSS Grid been trying and working harder to figure whats the best apprach of working with CSS Grid the result looks nice i will keep leanrning and going.


To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development
